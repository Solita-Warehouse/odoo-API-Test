# odoo-API-Test
This is a simple Java project that uses XmlRpc to connect to Odoo and fetch data. It is based on Odoo External API documentation  
## Getting started  
Clone this repository and make sure that maven dependencies are installed. Intellij from JetBrains is a good IDE for that.  
To run the code, you need an Odoo instance running on http://localhost:8069/
