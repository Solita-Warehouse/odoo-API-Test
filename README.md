# odoo-API-Test
This is a simple Kotlin project that uses XmlRpc to connect to Odoo and fetch data. It is based on Odoo External API documentation

## Branches  
The java branch was the first version of this test and it is a completely different project that used maven.  
The kotlin branch is the new version, this project uses gradle for dependencies.  
Those changes were made to be closer to the condition of the actual project that is a gradle project in kotlin.
